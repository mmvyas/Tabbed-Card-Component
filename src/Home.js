          <h1>Summary</h1>

          <p>
            We'd like some help creating a tabbed card component for showing
            small sets of information to users on demand.
          </p>

          <h2>Motivation</h2>

          <p>
            After doing some customer interviews, we noticed that many users
            found the amount of information on the product page a little
            overwhelming.
          </p>

          <p>
            We'd like to use a little "tabbed card" for this information instead
            so users only see one section at a time.
          </p>

          <h2>Design</h2>

          <p>
            I've attached some designs below for Desktop and a rough skeleton of
            how it might look on Mobile. I'm happy to leave the rest up to you
            folks.
          </p>

          <h2>API Examples</h2>

          <p>
            I don't quite know yet, but it'd be nice if we can make it flexible
            so we can use it for other sections not just the product
            information.
          </p>

          <p>
            We'll probably want to be able to have it open on a different tab by
            default depending on where the user is coming from, if that helps.
          </p>

          <h2>Attachments</h2>

          <div className={styles.attachments}>
            <a
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"

              style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${desktop})` }}

        <Speech character={eric} comment>
          <p>Looks good Kat!</p>

          <p>
            Remember we'll have to give this an accessibility once-over too.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wonder, will a tab ever be there but be empty or disabled? What
            will happen in that case?
          </p>
        </Speech>

        <Speech reverse character={jessica} comment>
          <p>
            I like the extra action at the bottom. Will all tabs have one and I
            guess they'll be different for each tab?
          </p>

          <p>
            I've seen some similar tabs in the Artist section, they're not
            connected to a Card like this though but it's something to think
            about.
          </p>

          <p>
            Am I right in assuming that the content of each tab will all be
            provided by the consuming app?
          </p>
        </Speech>

        <Speech character={serjio}>
          <p>
            I'm interested in what happens if we have too many tabs to fit
            across? Or is that just a guideline that we put in the
            documentation?
          </p>

          <p>
            Anyway, I think there's enough here for the Design System team to
            have a go at implementing a first pass of this.
          </p>
        </Speech>

        <Speech reverse character={you}>
          <p>
            @Eric we can have disabled tab, and it can be enabled once the user
            logs in. We can show previous orders of user in the disabled tab.
          </p>
          <p>
            @Jessica, I think for simplicity, single action at the bottom is
            preferable, multiple actions can be again lot of information for
            user. But, then again, for example for the Review section, there can
            be multiple actions - See all reviews and Add your review...{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I think we can make this tabbed card for generic purpose, if
            we can store the content in a JSON file.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            @Serjio, we can have auto-scrollable tabs, so as per Kat's designs
            if a fourth tab needs to be added, the tabs will automatically
            become horizontally scrollable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have started working on the component, added basic accessibility
            too... Have a look...
