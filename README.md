### Redbubble - Frontend Engineer

A "get to know you" exercise for the role of Frontend Engineer in Redbubble's Design System team


#### Instructions

You can find the instructions for this exercise on the site here:

http://rb-design-system-get-to-know-you.surge.sh/

#### Contributing / Setup

This app was created with `create-react-app`. Please refer to the `create-react-app` [documentation below](https://github.com/redbubble/react-get-to-know-you#available-scripts) for how to run the app, tests, etc.

#### Conventions and Creative Freedom

Below you'll find a brief overview of what we have setup in the app.

We **encourage you** to code the way you like to code - so install / re-configure / re-arrange to your heart's content. All we ask is that you:

- don't spend too long on the exercise, it's meant to be brief / fun
- complete the component using `react`

Here's what we've already setup:

##### Routes

We have setup `react-router` with:

- our instructions on the homepage route `/`.
- a space for you to show your work on the `/tab-component`.

##### Styles

We have provided some CSS Custom Properties (variables) containing some design tokens like our colors, borders etc. You don't have to use them, but they should help speed up the styling of your component.

That's it...the rest is up to you ðŸš€

#### Original `create-react-app` documentation

The following is the original documentation generated by the `create-react-app` tool, for your reference.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
